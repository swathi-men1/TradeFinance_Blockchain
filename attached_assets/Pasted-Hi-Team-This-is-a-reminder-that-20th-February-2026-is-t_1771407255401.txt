Final Presentation Details
Demo rehearsals will be conducted between 23rd – 26th February 2026.

The final presentation is not mandatory for everyone. Only those who are:

Well-prepared on the project

can volunteer to present.

Important Points:
Presentation must be delivered as a team of 5 members.

Discuss within your group and share the names by today without fail. 

As a team, you must decide the best project for presentation. The selected project should clearly meet all the given requirements, have proper UI, strong features and fully align with the project objectives.

Demo rehearsal is compulsory before the final presentation.

Presentation Structure (15 Minutes Total):
5 mins: PPT Overview

5 mins: Live Demo (Run the project beforehand; no code walkthrough)

5 mins: Q&A Session (Be well-prepared)

These steps are mandatory to properly document and evaluate your contribution.

If you have already completed all requirements, kindly ignore this message. Otherwise, treat this as a priority and complete your submission at the earliest.
